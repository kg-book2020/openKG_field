Loose parts are sensed moving in a conduit carrying a flowing material, such as the cooling circuit of a pressurized water nuclear reactor. An acoustic pickup produces an electrical signal with vibration of the conduit due to impact of the loose part, and background noise. A signal processor encodes the values of distinct parameters of the electrical signal such as amplitude, amplitude at particular frequencies, etc., in an ongoing manner, producing discrete output values. These outputs are coupled as inputs to a neural network with physical or logical neuron cells loaded with weighting factors affecting the strength and polarity of neural interconnections. The factors represent the acoustic signature of the loose part. Products of the input values and the weighting factors are summed to produce one or more neural network outputs, compared to a threshold. The sum normally varies randomly, but has a strong swing when the pattern is encountered, due to the factors emphasizing the pattern over background noise. The threshold comparison operates a display or alarm. The weighting factors are learned by repeating empirical tests and correlating the factors to the signal to minimize error.

An automatic tuner for control systems that produces, as output values, parameters of an arbitrary controller. The controller is in a control loop so that its output effects changes in actuators and regulates a physical process. The controller has either linear or nonlinear controller components, or a combination of both. The tuner has a nonlinear approximator that has been optimized off-line. The off-line optimization is done without supervised learning so that desired outputs of the nonlinear approximator do not need to be available, and separate optimization to generate the desired outputs is not necessary. The off-line optimization can also rely on arbitrary criteria. Such optimization ensures robustness of generated controller parameters so that the input process characteristics do not need to be highly accurate. The inputs to the nonlinear approximator consist of two sets of input parameters, either of which may be empty. A first set of input parameters can relate to process characteristics. A second set of input parameters can relate to desired closed-loop system behavior. The output values may be proportional and/or integral and/or derivative gains for PID-like controllers, or otherwise be parameters for delay-compensation controllers, controllers that consist of lead-lag terms in combination with PID controllers, higher-order linear controllers, or nonlinear controllers of predetermined structure. The nonlinear approximator may be implemented as a compositional sigmoidal mapping, a multilayer perception structure, a fuzzy logic model, a radial basis function network, a polynomial expansion, or other parametrized nonlinear structure.

The microprocessor normally executes programs which transfer data to the neural network co-processors, which are used to compute complicated mathematical functions. Direct Memory Access (DMA) is also used to transfer data. Each neural network co-processor interfaces to the microprocessor in a manner substantially similar to that of a conventional memory device. The co-processor does not require any instructions and is configured to execute mathematical operations simply by being pre-loaded with gating functions and weight values. In addition, the co-processor executes a plurality of arithmetic operations in parallel, and the results of such operations are simply read from the co-processor.

A computer-implemented technique is described for processing a linguistic item (e.g., a query) in an efficient and scalable manner. The technique interprets the linguistic item using a language understanding (LU) system in a manner that is based on a particular endpoint mechanism from which the linguistic item originated. The LU system may include an endpoint-independent subsystem, an endpoint-dependent subsystem, and a ranking component. The endpoint-independent subsystem interprets the linguistic item in a manner that is independent of the particular endpoint mechanism. The endpoint-dependent subsystem interprets the linguistic item in a manner that is dependent on the particular endpoint mechanism. The ranking component generates final interpretation results based on intermediate results generated by the endpoint-independent subsystem and the endpoint-dependent subsystem, e.g., by identifying the most likely interpretation of the linguistic item.

An information processing system having signal processors that are interconnected by processing junctions that simulate and extend biological neural networks. Each processing junction receives signals from one signal processor and generates a new signal to another signal processor. The response of each processing junction is determined by internal junction processes and is continuously changed with temporal variation in the received signal. Different processing junctions connected to receive a common signal from a signal processor respond differently to produce different signals to downstream signal processors. This transforms a temporal pattern of a signal train of spikes into a spatio-temporal pattern of junction events and provides an exponential computational power to signal processors. Each signal processing junction can receive a feedback signal from a downstream signal processor so that an internal junction process can be adjusted to learn certain characteristics embedded in received signals.

Generic, abstract, encapsulated, expandable and maintainable techniques for modeling and animating computer graphics display objects can be used in a variety of different computer applications and platforms including, for example, video games developed for inexpensive home 3D video game platforms. An abstract simulation entity definition for use in real time computer simulation and animation encapsulates both the physical and behavioral characteristics of a display object.

Each simulation entity has the knowledge or know-how of common operations, and the ability to communicate with other simulation entities. Two separate class hierarchies may be used to differentiate between abstract components and physical components of simulation entities: an entity class hierarchy may be used to specify data structures and methods for behavior and communication; and an object class hierarchy may be used to define geometry and animation information and functions. A simulation entity can possess more than one set of object information. This allows the entity to change form (e.g., from a tiger to a bird) or perform multi-functionality during its lifetime. The simulation entity construct allows for more accurate modeling of the real world, supporting automation of simulation software production, and distributed and/or remote processing.
