The aim of super resolution is to get high resolution (HR) images/videos from low-resolution (LR) images/videos. The obtained HR images/videos are expected to be clear and have less artifacts. Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) in the space domain is a super resolution method. It results in edge oscillation and produces many artifacts. This paper introduces a POCS method in both the space and the frequency domain. Firstly, a frequency domain POCS method is proposed. Then it is combined with the space POCS and the space-frequency POCS is obtained. Compared with the common bilinear interpolation method and the existing POCS method in the space domain, our method may decrease the edge oscillation phenomena and raise the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).
